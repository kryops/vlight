## Getting Started

### Using a Docker container

You can build and run this project through Docker (in a Linux container):

```
> ./docker-build.sh
> ./docker-run.sh
```

### Normal installation

Software needed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)

Build tools for native Node.js addons are also needed depending on your platform.

Install and setup:

```shellscript
> yarn
```

Start:

```shellscript
> yarn start
```

#### Windows Notes

The automatic installation of the Visual Studio Build tools does not include all features that are necessary to compile this project's addons. Find them under "Control Panel > Software / Apps & Features" and change the installation to contain the following features:

- Visual C++ ATL for x86 and x64

### Configuration

The base configuration is contained in the `config/vlight-config.js` file. It should offer documentation and auto-completion through TypeScript - otherwise, check out the [source](./backend/src/services/config.ts).

To switch projects, change the `project` setting. If you want to clone an existing project, just copy its folder inside the `config` directory.

The rest of the configuration is available in the UI:

- Fixture types are persisted globally
- All other entities and settings are persisted on a per-project basis

## Development

Start in development mode with hot reloading:

```shellscript
> yarn dev
```

### Protocols

[vLight Client Protocol via REST/WebSocket](./backend/src/services/api/README.md)

[vLight Binary Protocol via TCP/UDP](./backend/src/devices/vlight/README.md)
